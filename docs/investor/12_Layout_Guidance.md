# Logo & Layout Guidance (Deck/PDF)

- Preserve aspect ratios for **RAIN** and **RainStorm** wordmarks; no stretching.  
- Place **RAIN** logo (small) top‑right with “Reliable AI Network, Inc.” in small bold text.  
- Enable **text wrapping** for all tables; keep within margins.  
- For bullets with colons, **bold the lead‑in up to the colon**, normal text after.  
- Break long titles across lines; avoid cramming into one line.
