# RainStorm Suite — One-Pager
**Company:** Reliable AI Network, Inc. (Delaware C‑Corp)  
**Stage:** Seed | **Ask:** $1,000,000 (post‑money SAFE) | **Runway:** 12–15 months  
**Date:** 2025-09-28

## What RainStorm Is
**RainStorm** is an orchestrator that runs a full product loop — from **idea → build → price/release → market → onboard → measure → trust → support → back to idea** — using a focused set of apps (the **Rain‑suite**). Each action is policy‑checked and logged with **signed receipts**.

**Apps:** RainScout (discover), RainVibe (build), RainShip (price+release), RainWave (GTM assets), RainDock (provision+onboard), RainPulse (telemetry+NPS), RainBeacon (policies+receipts), RainRef (support+fixes).

## Why Now
- Teams want **verifiable AI**: not just outputs, but **evidence** (receipts, changelogs, policy decisions) and safe rollback.
- Suite fatigue: point tools don’t hand off well. RainStorm **automates the handoffs** with a single orchestrator and audit trail.
- Developer‑friendly pricing (Cursor‑adjacent) removes adoption friction.

## Who Buys
- **Seed–Series B SaaS (10–200 ppl)**: need faster validation, safer release, higher activation, less churn.
- **Agencies/Studios**: ship many MVPs weekly with receipts and predictable quality.
- **Platform/DevTool teams**: compliance‑aware releases, activation, and support actions.

## Pricing (Cursor‑friendly)
**RainStorm (orchestrator):** $99 / $299 / $699 per month (Starter / Growth / Scale)  
**Apps (à la carte):**
- RainVibe $199, RainShip $129, RainWave $99, RainDock $69, RainPulse $149, RainBeacon $199, RainRef $129, RainScout $149
**Bundles:** Build&Ship $299; GTM $149; Ops Guard $349; Full Loop $799  
**Indie:** $49/mo one app (light limits). Annual −20%

## Beta (45 days, survey‑gated)
- Capture card on Day 0 via **SetupIntent**; **charge only on Day 46** if survey rules met.  
- **Weekly 10‑minute survey** unlocks access; **7‑day late → revoke** until a survey is completed (restores 7 days).  
- Converts trials with real QA + proof, not coupons.

## Traction Goals (first 90 days post‑beta)
- 600–800 signups → ≥40% weekly survey completion → **10–15% paid** on Day 46.  
- MRR: **$40k–$80k** by Month 3 depending on bundle mix ($499–$899/mo).  
- Case studies: time‑to‑MVP ↓5–10×, failed deploys ↓70–80%, activation ↑20–40%.
- 5–10 design partners, 2 public references.

## Go‑to‑Market
- Wedge: **Build & Ship** (RainVibe+RainShip) for dev teams; **Ops Guard** (Pulse+Beacon+Ref) for PLG ops.  
- Channels: dev communities (Cursor/GitHub), partner agencies, PLG content with receipts, Zendesk/HubSpot marketplaces.  
- Parallel pipeline: multiple products per customer move through the loop at once — time is not the bottleneck; budget is.

## Moat
- **Evidence‑by‑default** (signed receipts for risky actions) + **policy‑as‑code** gates (OPA).  
- Orchestrated handoffs across apps (LangGraph), not a grab‑bag of point features.  
- Trust ramp: fewer HITL approvals over time, with auditability.

## Business Model
- Platform (RainStorm) + Apps (a la carte) + Bundles + Light usage add‑ons.  
- Mid‑market ACV target **$6k–$12k**; SMB **$2k–$6k**; indie **$49–$199/mo**.

## Path to $1M ARR
- **$899/mo blended** → ~**93 customers**.  
- **$499/mo blended** → ~**167 customers**.  
Focus: land 60–120 logos from beta cohorts; expand via bundles and additional products per customer.

## Use of Funds (12–15 months)
- Product & Engineering (45%): orchestrator hardening, receipts, connectors, Studio UI polish.  
- GTM (35%): devrel, content with receipts, partner program, marketplace apps.
