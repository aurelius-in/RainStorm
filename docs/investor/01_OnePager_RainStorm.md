# Reliable AI Network — RainStorm Suite
**Stage:** Seed | **Ask:** $1,000,000 (post-money SAFE) | **Runway:** 12–15 months  
**Company:** Reliable AI Network, Inc. (Delaware C‑Corp)  
**Product:** **RainStorm Suite** — operational AI that ships outcomes and “keeps receipts”: audit-ready evidence locker, signed artifacts, and policy‑as‑code reliability.

## Why Now
- Buyers want **verifiable** AI (evidence, audit trail, receipt-level outcomes) not slideware.
- Edge + multi‑agent orchestration is crossing the chasm in operations and GTM teams.

## What We Sell
- **RainStorm Hub** with attachable apps: RainVibe, RainShip, RainPulse, RainBeacon, RainWave, RainDock, RainScout, RainPolish.  
- Per‑site suite pricing with step‑up add‑ons by data source, line, or integration.

## Early Traction (design)
- 45‑day pilots with weekly outcomes; license‑key gating for participation.  
- Lighthouse intro pricing (¼ of target) for first logos with reference commitments.

## Go‑to‑Market
- Pilot → land the **Suite** → expand via apps and integrations; partner‑attached motion.

## Moat
- **Evidence by default** (signed artifacts, pass/fail images, SOP cites), **reliability posture** (signing, SBOM, policy gates), and modular orchestration.

## Team
- Founder‑led engineering with shipped multi‑agent and governance tooling; staged hires tied to milestones.

## Terms
- **$1,000,000 SAFE (post‑money cap target: $15M)**, pro‑rata & information rights for Major Investors; optional board observer.

## Funded Milestones (12–15 months)
- GA of RainStorm Hub + two flagship apps; 3–6 paying sites; NRR ≥ 110%; SOC 2 readiness; 99.9% SLO.
- ARR run‑rate target: $1.5–$3.0M depending on cohort curve.
