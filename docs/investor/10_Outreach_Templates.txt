Subject: RainStorm — operational AI with receipts — $1.0M SAFE

Hi <Name>,

We’re raising **$1,000,000 on a post‑money SAFE** (cap target **$15M**) to launch RainStorm Hub and two flagship apps, and to scale to 3–6 paying sites within 12–15 months. RainStorm ships outcomes and keeps **signed receipts** (artifacts, pass/fail images, SOP citations) with a strong reliability posture (signing, SBOM, policy gates).

If this fits your thesis, I can share the one‑pager, a deck outline, and the data room.

Best,
Oliver
