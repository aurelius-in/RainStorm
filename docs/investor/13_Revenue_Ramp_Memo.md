# Revenue Ramp to $1 Million — Scenarios and Assumptions (RainStorm)

## Executive Summary
We outline credible timelines to reach either (1) **$1M ARR** or (2) **$1M cash collected**. Timing depends on price per site, pilot conversion, sales cycle length, and pipeline volume.

## Definitions
- $1M ARR target: $83,333 in MRR.
- $1M cash collected: upfront payments (annual prepay) and services can accelerate cash before ARR crosses $1M.

## Pricing Anchors (illustrative)
- Suite target: $25k–$60k per site per month.
- Intro lighthouse pricing: ≈¼ of target.
- Example mix in scenarios: Suite at $25k target, intro $6.25k.

## Scenarios to $1M ARR
**Aggressive (6–9 months):** 40% pilot conversion; 10 sites at blended $8.75k–$12.5k MRR → $1.05M–$1.5M ARR.  
**Base (10–14 months):** 25–30% conversion; 9–11 sites → ~$1.1–$1.3M ARR.  
**Conservative (18+ months):** 15–20% conversion; 12–16 sites at $6.25k–$10k MRR.

## Target Math
| Avg MRR per site | Sites for $1M ARR |
|---:|---:|
| $6,250 | 14 |
| $10,000 | 9 |
| $12,500 | 7 |
| $25,000 | 4 |

## Cash Collected vs ARR
- **Annual prepay (10–15% discount)**: 6 sites at $12.5k MRR on annual prepay ≈ **$900k** at signing; onboarding/services can clear **$1M** cash before $1M ARR.

## Funnel Targets (base case)
Work 120 accounts → 40 SQLs → 20 pilots → 6 closed‑won. Maintain a 90‑day rolling top of funnel.

## Acceleration Levers
Price design (site + line add‑ons), prepay, reference program, partner attach, time‑boxed pilots with weekly evidence.

## Risk Controls
Payback < 9 months; NRR ≥ 110%; step‑up schedule after 12 months; logo churn < 2% monthly with early escalation.

## Bottom Line
Fastest credible path to **$1M ARR**: 6–9 months with ~10 landed sites.  
Fastest credible path to **$1M cash collected**: 4–6 sites on annual prepay plus onboarding fees.
