# Investor FAQ — RainStorm Suite

**What is RainStorm?**  
An operational AI suite with an **evidence locker** and policy‑as‑code reliability. It ships outcomes and keeps signed receipts (artifacts, reports, pass/fail images, SOP citations).

**Who buys it and why now?**  
Ops, Quality, and GTM leaders who need verifiable outcomes, not bespoke projects. Edge/agentic adoption plus governance demands make this urgent.

**How do 45‑day pilots convert?**  
Weekly outcome surveys paired with receipts; license keys unlock each week; opt‑out by day 45 or auto‑convert. Target 25–40% conversion by cohort.

**What’s the business model?**  
Per‑site suite with attachable apps and integration add‑ons. Intro pricing for lighthouses steps up after 12 months.

**Security & compliance?**  
Signed images, SBOM, policy gates; SOC 2 readiness by Month 9; tenant isolation; immutable logs.

**Terms?**  
$1.0M post‑money SAFE, cap target $15M, pro‑rata & information rights for Major Investors; observer optional.
