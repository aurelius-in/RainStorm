Seed–Series B SaaS, agencies, and platform teams who need faster validation, safer releases, higher activation, and verifiable automation.

**How does the 45‑day beta convert?**  
Card on Day 0 (SetupIntent), weekly 10‑min survey unlocks access; 7‑day late → revoke; **charge on Day 46** if compliant. Target **10–15% paid** from 600–800 signups per launch.

**What’s the pricing?**
