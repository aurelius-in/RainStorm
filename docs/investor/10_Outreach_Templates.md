Subject: RainStorm — orchestrated AI with receipts — 45‑day beta + $1.0M SAFE

Hi <Name>,

We’re shipping **RainStorm**, an orchestrated suite that runs the full product loop (idea→build→ship→market→onboard→measure→trust→support) and **keeps signed receipts** for every risky action. Pricing is Cursor‑friendly ($99 platform; apps $69–$199).

We’re offering a **45‑day beta**: provide card on Day 0, get free access, and we only **charge on Day 46** if weekly 10‑min surveys are completed (or opt out anytime).

We’re raising a **$1.0M post‑money SAFE (cap target $15M)** to bring GA + connectors and publish 3 case studies. If this fits your thesis, I’ll share the one‑pager and a short demo.
