# RainStorm — One‑Pager

**Tagline:** From **signal to ship** with proof.

**What:** RainStorm is an agentic product foundry that validates demand, builds software, prices & ships safely, launches campaigns, onboards users, measures health, automates with policy, and supports customers — with one human QA gate per cycle at high trust.

## Problem
Teams lose months on the wrong ideas, slow builds, risky releases, messy launches, poor onboarding, and blind post‑launch ops.

## Promise
A single orchestrated loop that makes **evidence‑based decisions**, ships **faster and safer**, and **learns every cycle**.

## Apps (Rain‑suite)
- **RainScout** (discover & validate)  
- **RainVibe** (build & preview)  
- **RainShip** (price & release)  
- **RainWave** (assets & GTM)  
- **RainDock** (provision & onboard)  
- **RainPulse** (health & signals)  
- **RainBeacon** (policy & trust ramp)  
- **RainRef** (support & fixes)

## KPIs
- Time‑to‑MVP ↓ 5–10×
- Failed deploys ↓ 80%
- Activation rate ↑ 20–40%
- Churn ↓, Expansion ↑
- Human approvals → **1 per cycle** at T3

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Spam/Compliance** → consent throttles, policy receipts (RainBeacon)  
- **Hallucinations** → grounded copy/code with tests, changelogs, citations  
- **Security** → SBOM, secrets scanning, OPA gates, rollback  
- **Brand** → brand tokens in RainWave; HITL for high‑risk sends

## 30 / 60 / 90
- **30**: RainScout + RainVibe + RainShip happy path; Studio UI MVP  
- **60**: RainWave + RainDock; consent & guardrails; receipts  
- **90**: RainPulse + RainBeacon + RainRef; trust ramp to T2+; loop closes
